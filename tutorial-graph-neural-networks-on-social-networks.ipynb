    "## 1. Set your expectations of this tutorial\n",
    "You can follow this tutorial if you would like to know about **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** through a practical example using PyTorch framework. \n",
    "I am aiming, at the end of this step-by-step tutorial, that you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Gain insights about what graph neural networks (GNNs) are and what type of problems they may solve.\n",
    "2. Know how graph datasets, which are expected by GNNs, look like. We will download and explore a social network dataset collected from GitHub.\n",
    "3. Construct graphs and visualize them using code.\n",
    "4. Construct and train a simple GNN model for node classification  task based on convolutional GNN using `torch_geometric`, the geometric deep learning extension library for `PyTorch`.\n",

    "## 2. GNN ≈ Graph + Convolution Neural Network!\n",
    "  \n",
    "*A __BIG__ __caveat__ here is to emphasize that I do not mean GNNs are just CNNs that operate on graphs, but what I want to say is that I felt comfortable with GNNs when I linked it to my understanding of CNNs and learnt something about graphs. For sure there are many other variations of GNNs but let us stick to this for those 10 minutes of reading. I hope this works for you as well, note that  I put the≈ sign to avoid causing some people to cringe.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph neural networks, as their name tells, are neural networks that work on graphs. And the graph is a data structure that has two main ingredients: nodes (a.k.a. vertices) which are connected by the second ingredient: edges. You can conceptualize the nodes as the graph entities or objects and the edges are any kind of relation that those nodes may have. Also you should know that both nodes and edges *can* have features (a.k.a. attributes), note the *can* as having features is not a *must*.\n",
    " \n",
    "Mathematicians like to be concise and they represent the graph as the set G = (V, E) where G, V, Eare the graph, vertices and edges sets respectively. But for our tutorial, let us make some visually appealing illustrations. The figure below  represents a graph that consists of 4 nodes, represented by those blue circles with indices (1,2,3 and 4) and connected by *directed* edges represented by those green arrows. This graph is directed because the edges may represent asymmetric relationship, for instance if the nodes represent social network users and node 1 follows node 2 it does not mean that node 2 follows node 1. The contrary is the *undirected* graph which has bidirectional edges, then the relation could be friendship for example. \n",

    "\n",
    "Since you are now reading this post about GNNs, I can confidently assume that you already have knowledge about CNNs. Yes, convolutional neural networks, the deep neural network class, that is most commonly applied to image analysis and computer vision applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us, if not all, already know that images consist of pixels and the CNN leverages the convolution operation to calculate latent (hidden) features for different pixels based on their *surrounding* pixel values. It does this by sliding a kernel (a.k.a. filter) over the input image and calculating the dot product between that small filter and the overlapping image area. This dot product leads to aggregate the neighboring pixel values to one representative scaler. Now let us twist our conceptualization of images a little bit and think of images as a graphs. You can think of the pixels of the image as the nodes of the graph and the edges are present only between the adjacent pixels. You might have your own way to represent the image as a graph, what matters is that you just have the image-to-graph concept in your mind. If you get this then it is easier for you to think of GNNs as a generic version of CNNs that can operate on graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using GNNs is the provision of a generalized form that enables us to exploit non-Euclidean space data. In contrast to the pixels representation of images, the graph can be visualized as a collection of nodes and edges without having any order. So if we can learn node features in the latent space, we can do many interesting things. Those things are under three main categories:\n",
    "1. *Graph classification*: where we can answer questions like: can we predict chemical compounds activity against lung cancer? Remember that chemical compounds can be represented as graphs with compound atoms as its nodes and chemical bonds are its edges.\n",
    "2. *Edge classification*: as an example we can predict the congestion in a particular street, if we are given the city map. Then our graph has the streets as its edges and their intersections as its nodes.\n",
    "3. *Node classification*: our tutorial problem falls under this category, as we are given a graph of a social network where users represent its nodes and the relationships between them are its edges and our task is to predict each user group (i.e. node class).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Adjacency matrix? Degree matrix? *an example*\n",
    "Let us take a simple type of graphs, the *undirected* graph, this graph type is simple because the relationship between nodes is symmetric. Let us have an example of undirected graphs which has some numerical features attached to its nodes as well as its edges. Those features can represent any attributes that describe a node (blue boxes) or an edge (green boxes). Features are normally vectors, but we represent them by scalers here for simplicity.\n",

    "![graph1](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4admdyj8cvgr3191b5w.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "We can express the above graph using two matrices which can capture its structure. The first is called the adjacency matrix and mostly denoted by **A** which is a square matrix used to represent finite graphs like this one. The elements of **A** indicate whether pairs of nodes are adjacent (i.e. connected by edges) or not in the graph. Those elements can be weighted (e.g. by edge features) as in our case; or can be unweighted (i.e. zeros \n",
    "for disconnected nodes and ones for the adjacent nodes). For our graph we come up with a symmetric matrix with zero diagonal as shown below. The other matrix is the features matrix **H** (a.k.a. graph signal **X**) which holds the nodes' features of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HandA](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rp7gummqde0jbxnseal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting operation that we may like to do is to calculate the dot product between those two matrices. This product, if we closely look at it, is generating a new feature vector that captures the feature of the surrounding nodes for each node based on how those surrounding nodes are connected to it. You can take a few seconds to relate the numbers on the calculation to the graph.\n",

    " \n",
    "Now, if we take a critical look at the result we can observe two problems. The first is that when calculating the entry of the features matrix **H'** for any of the nodes we *exclude* that particular node features from the calculation as shown by red zeros. Which seems to be absurd! in the sense that we are ignoring our *central* node! To solve this we can add self-connections to every node on the graph and this can be achieved by adding the identity matrix **I** to the graph adjacency matrix, which will alter its zero-valued diagonal to ones. So, now we can define the modified adjacency matrix **Ã** as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![abar](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1kmabqemuvw6asoou45d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is the risk that may result from *aggregating* the features as we might end up with extremely high values which can lead to computation instability. We can see already signs of that in our simple example on the latent feature matrix **H'** which has entries at least 10 times more than the entries in the original **H**. The solution of this problem is to *normalize* the latent features by dividing by the graph *degree* matrix **D** (specifically we multiply by its inverse). The degree matrix is a diagonal matrix that contains information about the number of edges attached to each vertex. Our graph degree matrix looks like this: \n",
    "![degree](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ys8qq5snrztj0hrw1zw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the latent space feature representation can be calculated by the following, note that you may see different ways to solve this problem in the literature, but their common goal is to achieve some level of normalization by exploiting the graph structure:\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Let us add some intelligence (learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we discussed how we can calculate latent features of a graph data structure. But if we want to accomplish a particular task we can *guide* this calculation toward our goal. Particularly, we can leverage our last equation to be multiplied by a *learnable* weight matrix **W** and apply a nonlinear function to the product as in the next equation. We can learn the optimal **W** based on the task at hand. And here is where we can start doing interesting things. \n",
    " \n",
    "![gnneq1](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rha625rk7xhh16jmu1cv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation wise, **W** can be a linear transformation (e.g. a linear layer) of the product and **Φ**is a non-linear activation function. I do not know if now you got the same intuition of mine (which is true) that we can stack as many functions of those as we like and learn the weight matrices **W** using backpropagation. Stacking those functions together promote this equation to be a deep learning model."

    "The splitting is not straight forward in our case as we have a single giant graph that should be taken all at once (there are some other ways to deal with graph segments, but let us assume this is the case for now). In order to tell the training phase which nodes that should be included during training and tell the inference phase which are the test data we can use *masks* which are binary vectors that indicate (using 0 and 1) which nodes belong to each particular mask. `torch_geometric.transforms.AddTrainValTestMask` class can take our graph and let us set how we want our masks to formed and it will add a node-level split via `train_mask`, `val_mask` and `test_mask` attributes. In our training, we use 30% as a validation set and 60% as test set while we keep only 10% for the training. You may have different split ratios, but in this way we may have a more realistic performance and we will not overfit easily (I know you might disagree with me on this point)! We can also print the graph information and the number of nodes each set (mask). The numbers between the brackets is the shape of each attribute tensor.\n",

Then we apply a `relu` activation function and deliver the latent features to the second layer which has output nodes equal to the number our classes (i.e. 2). In the `forward` function, `GCNConv` can accept many arguments `x` as the nodes features, `edge_index` and `edge_weight`, in our case we only use the first two arguments.\n",

We will define functions `masked_loss` and `masked_accuracy` for which we pass the respective masks and it returns the corresponding loss and accuracy.
